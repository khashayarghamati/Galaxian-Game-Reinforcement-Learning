# Galaxian Game Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of training an agent to play the Galaxian game using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent employs Q-learning rules and a single-neuron neural network to determine appropriate actions for different states within the game environment.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/khashayarghamati/Galaxian-Game-Reinforcement-Learning.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Monitor the training process and observe the agent's progress.

3. Once training is complete, run the agent in the game environment:
   ```bash
   python play.py
   ```
