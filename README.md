# Galaxian Game Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of training an agent to play the Galaxian game using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent employs Q-learning rules and a single-neuron neural network to determine appropriate actions for different states within the game environment.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Gymnasium library
- [Add any other dependencies here]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/galaxian-rl.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. Monitor the training process and observe the agent's progress.

3. Once training is complete, run the agent in the game environment:
   ```bash
   python play.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Script for training the RL agent.
- `play.py`: Script for running the trained agent in the game environment.
- `model.py`: Definition of the neural network model.
